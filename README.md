# The-best-Classifier

The project uses various classification algorithms such as :
<ul>
  <li>K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)</li>
  <li>Decision Tree</li>
  <li>Support Vector Machine</li>
  <li>Logistic Regression</li>
</ul>
to build a classifier.After building classifiers with the above mentioned algorithms the Jaccard index, F-1 Score and LogLoss are calculated for each algorithms and the best classifier is chosen.
